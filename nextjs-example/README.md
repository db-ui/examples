## Errors

- The [DBHeader](https://db-ui.github.io/mono/version/v0.0.68-beta/components/header/overview) usage example currently has incorrect props. `slotBrand, slotMetaNavigation, slotCallToAction, slotActionBar` should be `brand, metaNavigation, callToAction, actionBar` respectively



## Grievances

- Documentation page should be linked in the README.md as well. Its easy to miss in the description only
- Make the difference between foundation and *-components clearer. Do I need the foundation if I install the components?
- [Documentation page](https://db-ui.github.io/mono/version/v0.0.68-beta/components/drawer/overview) should allow to quickly switch between Overview/Properties/... (without the need to crawl through the nested navigation again)
